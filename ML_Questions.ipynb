    "\n",
    "2. You suspect multicollinearity in your regression model. How would you detect and resolve it?\n",
    " 💡 *Hint:* Use Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to identify highly correlated predictors and consider dimensionality reduction like PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You're working with categorical variables that have high cardinality. What's your encoding strategy?\n",
    " 💡 *Hint:* Use target encoding, frequency encoding, or embeddings instead of one-hot to avoid high dimensionality.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Your ARIMA model’s residuals are autocorrelated. What does this suggest?\n",
    " 💡 *Hint:* The model isn’t capturing all temporal structure — try adding seasonal terms or moving to SARIMA/Prophet.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. You’re forecasting demand, but COVID-19 caused a huge spike in 2020. How do you handle such anomalies?\n",

    "hashtag#ML Deployment / Production Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Your deployed model suddenly starts making worse predictions. What’s the first thing to check?\n",

    "\n",
    "8. Your model is slow during inference in production. What could be optimized?\n",
    " 💡 *Hint:* Quantization, model pruning, using a faster algorithm, or switching to a lightweight framework (ONNX, TensorRT).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. You’re working with a small dataset but need high accuracy. Would you choose a deep learning model or a traditional ML model? Why?\n",
    "💡 Hint: Deep learning tends to overfit on small datasets. Traditional models like decision trees, logistic regression, or SVMs are more data-efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Your model takes too long to train, even though the dataset is small. What would you check first?\n",
    "💡 Hint: High-dimensional data, redundant features, suboptimal algorithm choice, lack of feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Your classification model performs well overall but fails on a **minority class. How do you fix this?\n",
    "💡 Hint: Apply class imbalance techniques like SMOTE, weighted loss functions, or threshold tuning.\n",

    "1. Why do we split our dataset into training and testing sets, and how do you decide the right split ratio? \n",
    "2. How does regularization prevent overfitting, and why do we use techniques like L1 and L2? \n",
    "3. Why might a decision tree model overfit, and how can pruning help? \n",
    "4. If you have a highly imbalanced dataset, why might accuracy not be the best metric? What would you use instead? \n",
    "5. Why does the curse of dimensionality affect distance-based algorithms like KNN, and how can you address it? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural Language Processing Questions** \n",
    "1. Why is tokenization an essential step in NLP, and what challenges arise when working with non-English languages? \n",
    "2. Why do we use embeddings like Word2Vec or BERT instead of one-hot encoding for text data? \n",
    "3. How would you handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in a model? \n",
    "4. Why is stemming or lemmatization important, and when would you avoid using them? \n",
    "5. If you’re building a sentiment analysis model, why might stopwords still hold importance in some cases? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistics Questions** \n",
    "1. Why is p-value important in hypothesis testing, and what does a p-value of 0.05 really mean? \n",
    "2. If two variables have a high correlation, why doesn’t it always imply causation? \n",
    "3. Why might the mean be misleading for a highly skewed dataset? What would you use instead? \n",
    "4. Why do we prefer confidence intervals over point estimates in statistical analysis? \n",
    "5. In linear regression, why is it important to check for multicollinearity? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Senior-Level/Tricky Questions** \n",
    "1. Why might a gradient-boosting model outperform a deep learning model on small datasets? \n",
    "2. If a dataset shows perfect multicollinearity between two features, why might one of them still be important? \n",
    "3. When training a neural network for NLP, why might you freeze certain layers of the model? \n",
    "4. Why might sampling strategies like SMOTE sometimes fail in addressing class imbalance? \n",
    "5. Why does increasing the size of training data sometimes degrade performance on certain ML models? "
